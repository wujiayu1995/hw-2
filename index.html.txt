    // Description:

    // When complete, this program will ask the user how many roller coaster rides
    // they'd like to go on, then execute a block of code that many times.
    // The block will output which "ride" they're on, and change which image
    // is displayed on the page. The images shown will cycle through a list
    // of possible sources, though this happens so quickly that the user will only see
    // the final one shown.

    // There are explanatory comments thoughout. The work that still needs to be done
    // is noted in TODO comments. Please complete this work.


    // an array of possible image source values

    // select the <img> tag with id of "roller" from the HTML
    var theImg = document.querySelector("img#roller");

    // set the src attribute of the img to be the first element in source array
    theImg.setAttribute("src", imageSources[0]);

    // TODO: set howMany variable to a value user inputs
    var howMany

    var counter = 1;

    // TODO: execute this loop the number of times user requested
    while(false){
      console.log("Wheee! This is the ", counter, " time we've done this!");

      // find value of counter modulo length of sources array-
      // this value will increase by one on each iteration of the loop,
      // so image source will cycle through all possible images
      var theOne = counter % imageSources.length;
      // reset the src of the image to the next member of the sources array
      theImg.setAttribute("src", imageSources[theOne]);

      // TODO: increment the counter
    }

    // EXTRA CHALLENGES:
    // 1. Using JS, add a class of "red" to the <h1>.
    //    This only needs to be done once, so code should be outside loop.
    // 2. Execute the loop only half as many times, or twice as many times, as the user requested.
    // 3. Add a pause to each loop, so user can see each image as it cycles past.
    //    This is a difficult one!
